# Personal dataset-project
1. Motivation.
  The question I set out to answer is which Electric vehicle has a large range, AWD and is appealing.
  More specifically which cars can I narrow down to for longest range and AWD.  I ended up finding 
  this dataset because I was in the market for a new car and although this was a dataset that was 
  with electric vehicles I still wanted to explore and dig deeper to find what I am looking for in
  a car. This dataset was really interesting to look at and compare cars to gain more knowledge. 
  These cars are not the price range I was looking for but regardless it is a interesting dataset 
  to compare.
  
2. Data Process.
  I searched for datasets in places I knew. First thing I did was search online and after clicking 
  through a few links I found the dataset. It really helped me in gaining knowledge to answer my 
  original question. I first cleaned it up into cars the were AWD by sorting out all the other vehicles
  that weren't. Next I sorted all the cars had ranges from 400 KM to the max range amount of 970 KM.
  I also removed any vehicles that had data missing. I cleaned up the data into AWD powerTrain, model,
  brand and range in KM.  
  
  3. Visualizations.
    See comment.
 
 4. Analysis.
  I identified which data out of the dataset woud not be necessary for me to answer my question and removed
  it. I removed it so that it would be simpler to understand the visuals. It was simple to analyze this data 
  because when I narrowed it down to what I needed to answer my question it was simple. I created a barchart
  that has the AWD powertrain and the range shown. I created a barchart to show what I needed to answer my 
  question. The barchart visual answers that the vehicle that has AWD and longest range is a Tesla Roadster.
